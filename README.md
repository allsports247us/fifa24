Arsenal and Sporting CP face off at the Emirates in the second leg of the Europa League round of 16. An entertaining first leg ended 2-2 as both sides fight for a place in the quarter-finals.

While everything is going to plan in the Premier League, Arsenal return to Europa League action Thursday night with plenty of work to do if they are to book their passage to the quarterfinals ahead of Sporting CP. Last week, they drew 2-2 in Lisbon, frittering away an early lead with sloppy defending even if their attack still looked to be in fine fettle.

The Gunners have won all their three European games at home this season without so much as a goal conceded but Ruben Amorim's side might be the toughest opponent they have faced so far, winners of five of their last six games. Both sides come into this game off the back of impressive 3-0 wins at the weekend, and this could be the game of the round. Here is how you can watch it and what you need to know:

Arsenal‚Äôs task is simple: beat Sporting Lisbon at the Emirates, advance to the Europa League quarterfinals. It remains an open question how much priority the Gunners should place on the Europa League generally, but for now, they should set out to win the match. Going out at this point of the competition, at home, would be an ego / morale blow to the club. Arsenal are in good form. There‚Äôs no reason to risk losing that.

After an entertaining 2-2 draw in Portugal last week, there‚Äôs much to look forward to in the return fixture between Arsenal and Sporting Lisbon.

Say that to any of the travelling fans, though, and they won‚Äôt be happy.

Sporting are not, as they are regularly referred to in the English-speaking press, ‚ÄòSporting Lisbon‚Äô. They are Sporting Clube de Portugal officially, or Sporting CP, or simply Sporting. Whereas once this error was overlooked and forgiven, in recent years Sporting fans have become more militant about it. A ‚ÄúNOT Sporting Lisbon‚Äù campaign on social media in 2016, launched by fans and supported by the club, made this clear.

The 2-2 draw between the clubs last week was an entertaining but not all that well played match. Arsenal were sloppy in possession and loose at the back. Mikel Arteta was not thrilled with how his team played, but it was about what you‚Äôd expect to get from a rotated side that isn‚Äôt entirely familiar with each other in game situations. The Gunners should look much better at home, especially after Arteta likely read the team some version of the riot act in training this week.

Barring any unexpected injury or availability issues, expect Arteta to rotate his side from the weekend. Arsenal are mostly healthy knock on wood. Mohamed Elneny is out for the season with a knee injury. Eddie Nketiah is several weeks away from his return. The Arsenal manager revealed that the striker is still in a walking boot.

Sporting will be without captain Sebastian Coates and midfielder Hidemasa Morita through yellow card suspension. Midfielder Manuel Ugarte returns from a suspension that kept him out for the first leg and should start.

Goals could well flow in this tie, one which Arsenal are favorites to just about shade. PICK: Arsenal 3, Sporting 2 (after extra time)

Arsenal had an early lead in the first leg but found itself in need of a second-half Sporting own goal equalizer to head back to North London on level footing.

Sporting smashed Boavista 3-0 at the weekend in a dominant domestic showing, while Arsenal handled Fulham by the same score in Premier League play.
